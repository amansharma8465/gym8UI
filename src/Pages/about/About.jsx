                <h2> <span className='swet_year_span'>2015-2017</span> Once Upon a Time in Fitness </h2>




              </div>
              <div className='swet_content2'>
                <p>In 2015, we kicked off our fitness journey, led by the indomitable Samar Singh, because every great journey begins with a burpee, right? We started with group classes. Slowly, we went from crunches to credibility, gave demo sessions, created band value, and attracting a premium crowd that made our studio the place to be. Sure, we faced more hurdles than a hurdle workout: asset management chaos, no turn-ups, resource juggling. But hey, just like you persevered through that last set, we kept going. Why? Because it's not just about the sweat; it's about the journey.</p>

              </div>
              <div className='swet_content2'>
                <p>In the relentless pursuit of fitness excellence from 2017 to 2019, we didn't just set the bar; we raised it higher. In 2017, our first Zumba-focused fitness marathon ignited a wildfire of enthusiasm, prompting calls for more. Soon after, our inaugural fitness retreat marked the birth of a heartwarming bond among fitness, fun, and family. Slowly, our fitness retreats sprinkled across India, ahem! We were unstoppable. As our retreats spanned across India, our family expanded, with 19 core enthusiasts and 22 freelancers joining us voluntarily, affirming the resonance of our vision. Facing challenges, we realised fitness extends beyond individuals; it's a family affair.
                  Therefore, Kid’s Dance with Gymnastics entered the picture, where we unlocked morning potential for powerhouse moms so that they could break a sweat while kids had a blast. For us, it's not just a workout; it's a lifestyle, and it's always worth it.</p>

                <p>Surviving 2020–2022, where the entire nation was hit by COVID, was like acing an obstacle course! When the world hit pause, we hit play on online fitness. Turning the vibe from gym grunts to virtual victories was truly a challenge, but guess what? We made it the 'fitnesstic' highlight of the pandemic saga. Our gift to people : smiles and a dose of happiness. And can we talk about conversions? We had more flips than a gymnastics class. The secret sauce? Our community's resilience. We conquered challenges and turned every setback into a fitness comeback!</p>

                <p>Life's funny; they say it comes full circle, and so did our fitness journey post-COVID. We bounced back with a fresh vibe, a new zest, and a bit more swagger. Slowly, we expanded, opening new branches, and spiced up our fitness menu with top-notch amenities. Workshops and events became our thing—enter the event management squad. To keep the clients going, we even summoned a calling team because consistency is our love language. Tracking routines, smashing monotony, and bringing in a nutrition perspective—Eight Step Studio became a household fitness destination. This story is just getting started, so stay tuned for the next chapter!</p>
